# 🧠 Fine-Tune Your First LLM Using Alpaca-Style Data

This repository contains a Colab-ready notebook that walks you through the **step-by-step fine-tuning of a Large Language Model (LLM)** — specifically **LLaMA-2-7B-chat** — using Hugging Face tools and Alpaca-style instruction data.

## 🚀 What You'll Learn

- 🔐 Authenticate with Hugging Face securely
- 🔧 Install and configure necessary libraries
- 🧠 Load a quantized (4-bit) LLaMA-2 model
- 📚 Load and process an instruction-following dataset
- ✂️ Format and tokenize the dataset for chat-style prompting
- 🧩 Apply Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) using LoRA
- 🚂 Train and evaluate your fine-tuned model
- 💾 Save and reuse your trained model

## 🧠 Why Fine-Tuning LLMs Is Important

Fine-tuning allows you to:

- ✅ **Customize**: Adapt general models to your specific tasks and domain
- 💡 **Improve Accuracy**: Increase relevance and reduce hallucinations in domain-specific contexts
- 💰 **Save Resources**: Use lightweight fine-tuning methods like LoRA to avoid full model retraining
- 🧩 **Control Behavior**: Align the model’s tone, responses, or structure with your goals
